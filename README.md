PT 1: CHARACTER GENERATOR
-randomly generates a fantasy character with name and flavor text
-name is randomly generated between 1 to 3 syllables, with the first syllable coming from one array, and the second and third syllables coming from a second array
-the flavortext is similarly generated, with each section taking a prompt from one array and combining it with an option from a second array

PT 2: LOOT GENERATOR
-randomly generates a list of loot between 1 to 3 items
-loot arrays are weighted and organized by category, so that items from certain arrays are more commonly generated than others
-the three main loot categories are weapons, clothing, and trinkets, with each category subdivided into common and rare
-each subarray is weighted to make some categories more commonly chosen from that others
-once a subcategory is chosen chance weighted by category, the item within that category is truly selected at random
