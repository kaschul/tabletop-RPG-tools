# CHARACTER GENERATOR
- randomly generates a fantasy character with name and flavor text
- name is randomly generated between 1 to 3 syllables, with the first syllable coming from one array, and the second and third syllables coming from a second array
- much of the flavortext is similarly generated, with each section taking a prompt from one array and combining it with an option from a second array to increase the variety of responses

# LOOT GENERATOR
- randomly generates a list of loot between 1 to 3 items
- loot is weighted by category, so that items from certain arrays are more commonly generated than others (for example, items from 'weapons.common' are much more likley to appear than items from 'trinkets.rare'
- the three main loot categories are weapons, clothing, and trinkets, with each category subdivided into common and rare
- once a subcategory is chosen chance weighted by category, the item within that category is truly selected at random
